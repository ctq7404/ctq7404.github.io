<h4>Full Automation:</h4>
<p> Full Automation represents a future in which society aims to fully integrate artificial intelligence into vehicles, leading to the widespread adoption of fully autonomous vehicles. Optimistically, this approach offers a future with a significant reduction in traffic accidents as human error is no longer a factor, it promises to revolutionize the efficiency of our transport systems, and benefit everybody in terms of accessibility and convenience. However,
this approach also presents significant challenges to be overcome in its implementation. According to the study "Contested visions and sociotechnical expectations of electric mobility and vehicle-to-grid innovation in five Nordic countries"*, there are varying expectations and visions associated with the transition to electric mobility, which includes autonomous vehicles. The study found that the transition to electric mobility, including full automation, could lead to a "rapid electric society" and "ubiquitous and clean automobility". However, it also identified potential negative visions,such as the risk of "broken businesses" as traditional businesses struggle to adapt to new technology. It identifies other potential risks with the implementation of autonomous vehicles such as "hacked grids", "frozen families" and "captive consumers", the latter, if the full automation approach is chosen, references the possibility that societies will become overly reliant on this technology, and should the implementation of autonomous vehicles fail or produce unwanted, unforeseen effects, the consequences could be dire. 
Should it be perfectly implemented, this approach is no doubt a great option. However it's larger scope makes it a riskier endeavour than other approaches.

<h4>
Hybrid Approach:
</h4>
</p>
The hybrid approach refers to the middle-ground option, where AI assists human drivers in various ways, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This approach combines human decision-making with AI technology to enhance safety and performance.​ This approach acknowledges the advances AI has made, but recognizes that it still has shortcomings. It allows for humans to retain control over the vehicles, but to recieve assistance from AI in certain situations.
<br>
</p>
<h4>
Limited Autonomy:
</h4>
<p>
 Limited autonomy is an approach where integration is limited to specific functions, such as self-parking or adaptive cruise control. The primary responsibility for driving remains with the human driver, but AI supports certain tasks to improve convenience and safety.​ This can be seen as a cautious step towards more automation. It allows society to benefit from AI, without needing to fully give up control. The article "Artificial intelligence policy in India: a framework for engaging the limits of data-driven decision-making"** suggests that policies for Autonomous vehicles must consider the current limitations of AI systems - eg. restricting the use of Autonomous Vehicles in environments where it has not yet proven reliability. The article supports the idea of limited autonomy, arguing that the current technological limitations of AI need to be recognized and used to create policy that ensures it is used only in safe environments. 
<br>
</p>
<h4>
Incremental Adoption:
</h4>
<p>
Incremental adoption references a future where autonomous vehicles are introduced gradually through controlled environments before being expanded to broader use cases such as public roads. This approach allows for more testing and refinement, with less drastic consequences should the implementation prove to be unsuccessful. The study "On-demand high-capacity ride-sharing via dynamic trip-vehicle assignment"*** provides valuable insights into the potential of Incremental Adoption. The research presents a highly scalable, anytime optimal algorithm for ride-sharing that can match large groups of riders to a fleet of shared vehicles in real-time. 

This research supports the idea of Incremental Adoption by showing that a gradual introduction of autonomous vehicles in a ride-sharing context could significantly improve efficiency and service levels. The use of a scalable algorithm allows for real-time adjustments to meet demand, demonstrating the potential for autonomous vehicles to adapt to changing conditions and needs.

Incorporating these findings, the Incremental Adoption approach can be seen as a pragmatic and flexible strategy for introducing autonomous vehicles. However, doing so requires significant planning and investment. It may also lead to a patchwork of regulations and standards. The study suggests that the use of advanced algorithms can help manage these complexities, enabling a smooth and efficient transition to a more autonomous transportation system.

Incremental Adoption offers a balanced and adaptable approach to integrating autonomous vehicles. It combines the benefits of utilizing AI technology with the caution and practicality necessary for safe implementation, providing a pathway toward a more sustainable and efficient transportation system. However, by regulating every step of implementation, we may be unnecessarily slowing our development and sacrificing the opportunity to better many people's lives.
</p>
<br>
Each of these approaches has its own particular advantages and disadvantages. Which option is selected, depends on a variety of factors, economic,technological and societal. It is likely that as autonomous vehicles are implemented throughout the globe, we may see a combination of these approaches, adapted to the unique circumstances of different areas.
