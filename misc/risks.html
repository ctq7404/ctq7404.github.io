<h1>Risks</h1>


</ul><h5><p>What are the risks posed by autonomous vehicles?.<p></h5>
<p>Cybersecurity threats: As vehicles become more connected and dependent on AI, they are at greater risk to cyberattacks. Hackers may target AI systems to obtain unauthorized access, take control of the vehicle remotely, or manipulate sensor data. This may result in accidents, vehicles being stolen, or even ransom demands. ​

Safety risks: Although AI has the potential to improve road safety, it is not perfect. Both drivers and pedestrians may be at danger for injury or death as a result of problems including misunderstanding of sensor data, slow response to unexpected scenarios, or relying on incorrect or out-of-date information. ​

Ethical dilemmas: AI systems in vehicles must make decisions quickly in difficult situations, including dealing with unavoidable crashes.  These choices include moral concerns, such as prioritizing the safety of passengers versus other road users or choosing the lesser of two potential harms. Resolving such ethical dilemmas is challenging, as it requires establishing universally accepted guidelines for AI decision-making in critical situations.​
