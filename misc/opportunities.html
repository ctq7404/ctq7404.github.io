</ul><h5><p>What opportunities do autonomous vehicles present?<p></h5>
<p>​

Autonomous vehicles are simply cars with heavy AI integration. They represent huge technological breakthroughs which have the power to revolutionize the way we travel today and how we will travel in the future. Autonomous vehicles provide society with numerous benefits and opportunities across the board including different industries and sectors of society. There are a lot of ways autonomous vehicles will improve society's methods of transportation, safety, economy, convenience and sustainability. 

 <br>

The first way Autonomous vehicles will help us in our daily lives is through increased safety since safety is a very crucial aspect of vehicles integrated with AI due to their highly accurate sensors, AI algorithms and real time data processing. Due to these safety measures which are integrated into autonomous vehicles they have the power to potentially eliminate a lot of accidents and harm inflicted by the use of normal vehicles which are caused by human error. According to (World Health Organization: WHO, 2022)* more than 1.3 million people die each year due to accidents on the road. This number could be greatly reduced if we eliminate human error from the picture as humans can differ in their reaction times whereas an AI controlled camera at the front of the car will instantly identify if there is a person or obstacle on the road and can execute appropriate safety measures according to the situation. Autonomous vehicles can also improve safety by allowing the passengers of the vehicle to be occupied elsewhere while in the car, we all know people tend to text and drive or maybe eat in the car if they’re running late for work or uni which is very dangerous as they aren’t deploying 100% of their focus on driving. If we had self-driving cars this wouldn’t be a problem as drivers and passengers can easily eat or catch up on their text and calls without having to split their attention between driving and other tasks as this will all be carried out by the AI controlling the autonomous vehicle. 

 <br>

Another opportunity for autonomous vehicles to benefit society will be by improving our economy. There are multiple ways we can utilize autonomous vehicles to do this. The first reason is that the development, manufacturing and maintenance of autonomous vehicles will create a wide range of job opportunities. This includes but is not limited to engineers who specialize in robotics, AI development, cybersecurity and sensor technology, as well as mechanics and technicians who are skilled in developing, maintaining and repairing AI integrated vehicles. 
<br>
Secondly, by integrating autonomous vehicles into our daily lives it comes with the benefit of decreased spending and increased savings for both individuals and businesses. With self-driving cars, the need for human drivers is essentially eliminated which will result in lower labor costs for transport and delivery companies in the long run which means those funds can be reinvested into the economy elsewhere. 
<br>
Furthermore, as stated above, autonomous vehicles will allow people to reclaim their time that they had previously spent on commuting to work and back home. Obviously now we aren’t allowed to use handheld devices while driving our cars but the introduction of AI integrated vehicles such as self-driving cars will allow individuals to free up their time and spend it more productively on what they want whether it be work or leisure activities. Some people spend upwards of an hour traveling to work and back and are sleep deprived since they have to wake up early and get home late especially during peak traffic hours before and after work times. If we all used self driving it would benefit these individuals more as they would be able to catch up on lost sleep during the commute to and from work, or catch up on important work and business phone calls/emails which will reduce the amount of time they have to spend in the office allowing them to work more productively and efficiently on things that they need to focus more attention on at work and home. A secondary benefit of this example could also be that autonomous vehicles can lead to people having happier homes as people will have more sleep and hopefully be less cranky and be able to spend more time with their families. 

 <br>

Moreover there are multiple ways that autonomous vehicles can help with environmental conservation and sustainability. One of these oppurtunities are through reduced emissions from the use of autonomous vehicles. This is because autonomous vehicles have the ability to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gasses. Especially self driving cars which can be programmed to drive and operate more efficiently, unnnceceesary idling, optimizing speed, braking patterns and heavy accelerations which will significantly reduce fuel emissions and expenditure for individuals. Self driving cars can employ new technology that will turn off the engine at traffic lights to reduce carbon dioxide and gas emissions, which will lead to better fuel economy in the long run. 

Autonomous vehicles will also assist urban planners in designing new roads and and in infrastructure planning and development. Urban planners can analyze data collected from self-driving cars can assist planners to gain insights into traffic patterns and individuals traffic behaviours. This information will assists in designing and optimizing road designs to make daily commutes more efficient for both individual commuters and those using public transport including placing traffic lights at the most optimal places, placing bus lanes where needed, placing bike lanes where needed and to increase safety of cyclists.  

 

The implementation of Autonomous vehicles presents multiple oppurtunities to improve society as a whole as it has been stated. It brings enhanced safety measures during peoples commute and  day to day use of the road by the use of new technology , improvements in our current economic state by saving money for individuals and businesses.
