</ul><h5><p>What opportunities do autonomous vehicles present?<p></h5>
<p>​

Enhanced Safety: AI integration in autonomous vehicles can significantly improve road safety by reducing human errors, which account for the majority of accidents. AI technologies such as computer vision and machine learning algorithms enable advanced perception and decision-making capabilities, allowing cars to detect and respond to potential hazards more effectively.​

Increased Efficiency: AI-powered autonomous vehicles can optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. Through real-time data analysis and intelligent routing, AI can help vehicles adapt to changing road conditions, minimize idle time, and find the most efficient routes, resulting in reduced travel times and fuel consumption.​

Improved Accessibility: Autonomous vehicles have the potential to enhance mobility for individuals who are unable to drive due to age, disabilities, or other reasons. With AI, self-driving cars can enable greater independence and freedom for people with limited mobility, improving their overall quality of life.​
