  <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/192179726">Autopilot Full Self-Driving Hardware  (Neighborhood Short)</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user128712855">Tesla</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
</section>
<p>This impressive demonstration shows the recent progress made in both modern vehicle hardware and AI. It highlights the transformative potential of fully autonomous vehicles, which when equipped with AI algorithms and advanced sensors, can perceive their environment and navigate without human intervention. This underpins a potential paradigm shift in transportation with profound implications for safety, efficiency, security and accessibility that will likely result in many wider cultural changes as urban environments adapt to the implementation of autonomous vehicles. As of this moment, societies all around the world are still faced with the challenge of determining how autonomous vehicles should be implemented and how continuing developments in the technology should be regulated. We will have to weigh the risks that it poses with the opportunities it presents to determine whether, and if so, how quickly this technology will be permitted to reshape our lives.
Driver assistance systems are already being used to a limited degree, and the extent to which we automotatize vehicles in both the public and industrial sectors is still in question. A myriad of potential futures present themselves, and society must proceed with caution.<br>
